# Encryption/Decryption Code


### This code allows encrypting & decrypting a collection of files when the user first inputs the correct password. 

Follow these procedures to ensure the code to function correctly: 


>**line 56, change the path of where your images are initially located for encryption;
> lines 58-59, change where the encrypted files should be stored;
>  line 65, change the path of where your password.txt is stored; 
>  line 62 & 95, append/remove the file you would like to encrypt from f.endswith('.filetype');**


## Note:

This code will not decrypt with other files that have been encrypted from a different software/code. The files can only be decrypted from files
that have been encrypted by the code alone.
