# Encryption/Decryption Code


This code allows encrypting & decrypt a collection of files when the user first inputs the correct password.


Follow these procedures to ensure the code to function correctly:

line 56, change the path of where your images are initially located for encryption;
lines 58-59, change where the encrypted files should be stored;
line 65, change the path of where your password.txt is stored;
line 62 & 95, append/remove the file you would like to encrypt from f.endswith('.filetype')
